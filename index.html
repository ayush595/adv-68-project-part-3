            Taekwondo, usually thought of by most people as just a way of fighting, and as being a brutal sport. People consider it brutal because of all the kicks, punches, throws, and arm and wrist locks; they usually aren't open minded enough to see the way it benefits people especially children. Though a majority of it includes fighting, taekwondo also helps a person with self-confidence, self-defense and discipline.
             Developing self-confidence is an important aspect of learning taekwondo. Through gaining self-confidence the student learns to believe in his/her abilities. In believing in his/her abilities the students performance would be affected in and out of the dojo. As the student's self-confidence rises, so will his/her attitude. Once the students' confidence begins to rise their attitude, in general, rather it is at work, school, or at home usually improves. In time he/she will develop an indomitable spirit. The student should always be willing to keep trying as he/she progresses through the belt levels. As the student rises through the belt ranks, the self-confidence he/she develops in the dojo will benefit him/her throughout their life.
             The thought of learning self-defense is usually the main reason for people to join taekwondo. In addition to learning self-defense, taekwondo is also very demanding physically. Warms up exercises in taekwondo usually consist of push-ups, sit-ups, squats, stretches, and crunches. Self-control is mandatory when learning taekwondo. Without self-control the student can seriously injure other students or his/her-self.
             Along with learning self-control and becoming physically fit, the students also learn about martial arts weapons. Weapons are usually taught as being an extension of the student's hands. In becoming physically fit, learning self-control and weapons, the students are on their way to becoming very well rounded martial arts
